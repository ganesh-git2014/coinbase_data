# coinbase_data


Just a python program to loop through and pull GDAX data by the minute.  You can just grab the csv file if that's all you want.  
It has time, low, high, open, close, and volume for each minute.  
Current dates are 1/24/2015 to 8/16/2016  ...but you can just run the program to get more dates
